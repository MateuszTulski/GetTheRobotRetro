# GetTheRobotRetro

GetTheRobot Retro is a simple video game written in C++. Game concept is based on the mobile game, made by the RTStudioGames team.

Project contains two main scenes: main menu and one level.
Playerâ€™s main goal is to catch the running robot. 

Obstacles: For now the game provides only one type of obstacle, yellow electric traps. They reduce the player's HP by 3 out of 10 points. Losing all of your HP points is game over.

Coins: The player can collect coins, but in this simple demo this doesn't really apply. In Original GTR for Android it allows buying special boosters.
