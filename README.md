# GetTheRobotRetro

GetTheRobot Retro is a simple video game written in C++. Game concept is based on the mobile game, made by the RTStudioGames team.

Project contains two main scenes: main menu and one level.
Playerâ€™s main goal is to catch the running robot. 

Obstacles
For now the game provides only one type of obstacle, yellow electric traps.

Coins
The player can collect coins, but in this simple demo this doesn't really apply. In Original GTR for Android it allows buying special boosters.

**Dependencies**
To compile you need SDL2 - https://www.libsdl.org
